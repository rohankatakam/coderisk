# CORRECTED: CodeRisk Launch Strategy V2

**Created:** 2025-10-13
**Status:** CORRECTED - Graph Database + API Key Both Required
**Critical Correction:** Docker + init-local is REQUIRED, not optional

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CORRECTION V2

**V1 mistake:** Suggested Docker + init-local is "optional" for full analysis.

**Reality:** The graph database (Neo4j/Neptune) is **REQUIRED** for the core agentic investigation. Without it:
- LLM has no graph to navigate
- No IMPORTS, CALLS, CO_CHANGED relationships
- No temporal coupling detection
- No architectural risk assessment

**Both are REQUIRED:**
1. ✅ OpenAI API key (LLM reasoning)
2. ✅ Graph database (Docker + Neo4j + init-local)

---

## Correct Architecture

### What's Required for CodeRisk to Work:

**1. OpenAI API Key** - LLM for reasoning
- Synthesizes evidence
- Decides what to investigate next
- Assesses confidence
- Cost: $0.03-0.05/check

**2. Graph Database** - Stores relationships
- Tree-sitter AST (code structure)
- Git history (CO_CHANGED relationships)
- Temporal patterns (files changed together)
- Setup: Docker + 15 min ingestion

**3. Phase 0 Pre-Filter** - Optimization (< 50ms)
- Detects security keywords → escalate
- Detects docs-only → skip expensive analysis
- NOT a replacement for agentic investigation

### Investigation Flow:

```
Step 0: Phase 0 Pre-Filter (<50ms, no LLM, no graph)
  ↓ Security keywords? Docs-only? Config?

Step 1: Phase 1 Baseline (1-2s, REQUIRES API key + graph)
  ↓ LLM queries graph for 1-hop neighbors
  ↓ Calculates coupling metrics
  ↓ Makes initial assessment

Step 2: Phase 2 Deep Investigation (2-5s, REQUIRES API key + graph)
  ↓ LLM navigates graph (3-5 hops)
  ↓ Finds CO_CHANGED patterns
  ↓ Synthesizes evidence
  ↓ Stops at 85% confidence

Result: <3% FP rate ✅
```

## What Doesn't Work (Missing Requirements)

### ❌ Without API Key:
```bash
crisk check
# Error: OPENAI_API_KEY not set
```

### ❌ Without Graph (No init-local):
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
crisk check
# Error: Graph not initialized
# Run: docker compose up -d && crisk init-local
```

### ❌ With API Key but No Graph:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
# Docker not running or init-local not done
crisk check
# Phase 0: Complete (0.05s)
# Phase 1: FAILED - Cannot query graph (Neo4j not reachable)
# Error: Connection refused bolt://localhost:7687
```

**The LLM needs the graph to navigate!**

---

## Correct Setup (BOTH Required)

### Full Setup (15-20 minutes total)

```bash
# 1. Install CLI (30 seconds)
brew install rohankatakam/coderisk/crisk

# 2. Add API key (30 seconds) - REQUIRED
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# 3. Start Docker infrastructure (2 minutes) - REQUIRED
docker compose up -d
# Starts: Neo4j, PostgreSQL, Redis

# 4. Ingest repository (10-15 minutes) - REQUIRED
cd your-repo
crisk init-local
# Builds graph: Tree-sitter AST + Git history
# Creates: IMPORTS, CALLS, CO_CHANGED relationships

# 5. Check for risks (2-5 seconds) - NOW IT WORKS
crisk check
# ✅ Phase 0: Pre-filter (0.05s)
# ✅ Phase 1: Baseline assessment (1.2s) - Queries graph
# ✅ Phase 2: Deep investigation (2.3s) - Navigates graph
#
# Risk: HIGH
# Evidence: 12 dependencies + 0.87 co-change + security keywords
# Confidence: 87%
```

**Total setup time:** ~17 minutes (one-time per repo)
**Check time:** 2-5 seconds (after setup)

---

## Why Graph is Required (Not Optional)

### The Graph Stores:

1. **Code Structure (Tree-sitter AST)**
   ```cypher
   (auth.py:File)-[:IMPORTS]->(user_service.py:File)
   (login:Function)-[:CALLS]->(validate_token:Function)
   ```

2. **Temporal Patterns (Git History)**
   ```cypher
   (auth.py)-[:CO_CHANGED {frequency: 0.87}]->(session.py)
   // These files changed together 87% of the time
   ```

3. **Architectural Relationships**
   ```cypher
   (AuthModule)-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(UserModule)
   (PaymentService)-[:CALLS]->(StripeAPI)
   ```

### What LLM Does with Graph:

**Without graph:**
```
LLM: "Show me files that import auth.py"
Response: Error - no graph data
```

**With graph:**
```
LLM: "Show me files that import auth.py"
Graph: [session.py, middleware.py, routes.py]

LLM: "What's the co-change frequency with session.py?"
Graph: 0.87 (changed together 15 of 17 times)

LLM: "Show me functions that call validate_token()"
Graph: [login(), refresh_session(), admin_auth()]

Synthesis: HIGH risk - auth.py is tightly coupled (12 deps)
+ temporally coupled with session.py (not changed)
+ past incident #453 similar pattern
Confidence: 87%
```

**The graph is the knowledge base the LLM navigates!**

## Correct Pricing

### Local Mode (Self-Hosted)

**Requirements:**
- OpenAI API key: $0.03-0.05/check
- Docker: Free (you run it)
- Graph ingestion: 15 min one-time setup

**Monthly cost (100 checks):** $3-5 (just OpenAI API)

**One-time setup:** 17 minutes
**Best for:** Individual developers, small teams, privacy-sensitive

### Cloud Mode (Hosted)

**Requirements:**
- OpenAI API key: $0.03-0.05/check
- Cloud subscription: $10-50/user/month
- Graph ingestion: We handle it (0 setup)

**Monthly cost (100 checks):** $13-55 ($10-50 subscription + $3-5 LLM)

**Setup time:** 30 seconds (just add API key)
**Best for:** Teams, enterprises, zero DevOps

## Correct Positioning

### Headline:
```
Open Source AI Code Risk Assessment
LLM-powered agentic graph search - <3% false positives
```

### Subheadline:
```
15-minute setup (one-time per repo). Self-hosted or cloud.
Transparent LLM costs: $0.03-0.05/check (BYOK).
```

### Value Props:

1. **<3% False Positive Rate**
   vs 10-20% industry standard (SonarQube, etc.)

2. **Agentic Graph Investigation**
   LLM navigates your code graph intelligently

3. **Transparent Costs**
   BYOK model - you control LLM spend, no markup

4. **Self-Hosted Option**
   Run entirely on your machine (local mode)

5. **Quick Checks After Setup**
   2-5 seconds per check after initial ingestion

### What NOT to Say:

❌ "Works without setup"
❌ "Optional graph database"
❌ "Free tier"
❌ "No configuration needed"

### What to Say:

✅ "15-minute one-time setup per repo"
✅ "Graph database required for agentic navigation"
✅ "$3-5/month LLM costs (100 checks)"
✅ "Self-hosted: full privacy, you control infrastructure"

## Installation Instructions (Corrected)

### Local Mode Setup

```markdown
## Installation (15-20 minutes one-time per repo)

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed
- OpenAI API key ([get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))

### Step 1: Install CLI (30 seconds)
\`\`\`bash
brew install rohankatakam/coderisk/crisk
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Configure API Key (30 seconds)
\`\`\`bash
crisk configure
# Enter your OpenAI API key: sk-...
\`\`\`

Or manually:
\`\`\`bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc for persistence
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Start Infrastructure (2 minutes)
\`\`\`bash
docker compose up -d
# Starts: Neo4j (graph), PostgreSQL (metadata), Redis (cache)
\`\`\`

Wait for services to be ready:
\`\`\`bash
docker compose ps
# All services should show "running (healthy)"
\`\`\`

### Step 4: Initialize Repository (10-15 minutes)
\`\`\`bash
cd your-repo
crisk init-local
# Progress: Parsing files → Building graph → Analyzing git history
# This builds the graph the LLM will navigate
\`\`\`

### Step 5: Start Checking (2-5 seconds)
\`\`\`bash
crisk check
# ✅ Phase 0 + Phase 1 + Phase 2 complete
# Risk assessment with <3% FP rate
\`\`\`

---

### What You Get

After setup, every `crisk check`:
- Analyzes your changes in 2-5 seconds
- LLM navigates your code graph
- Finds coupling, temporal patterns, risks
- Costs $0.03-0.05 (your OpenAI account)

### Setup Time Breakdown
- Install CLI: 30 sec
- Configure API key: 30 sec
- Start Docker: 2 min
- Graph ingestion: 10-15 min (depends on repo size)

**Total: ~17 minutes** (one-time per repo)
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Current Status (From Your Test):

You've tested on **omnara repo** (~2.4K stars, 15 min ingestion).

**What's been validated:**
- ✅ Graph ingestion works (init-local completed)
- ✅ Security keyword detection works (Phase 0)
- ✅ Risk assessment works (detected CRITICAL API key logging)
- ✅ LLM investigation works (Phase 2 ran successfully)

### Additional Testing Needed:

**1. Diverse Repo Sizes (3-5 repos)**

Test CodeRisk on repos of different sizes to validate performance:

| Repo Type | Files | Expected Ingestion | Expected Check | Priority |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|----------------|----------|
| **Small** | 100-500 | 2-5 min | <3s | Medium |
| **Medium** | 1K-3K | 10-15 min | 3-5s | **HIGH** (✅ Done: omnara) |
| **Large** | 5K-10K | 20-30 min | 5-8s | Medium |

**Recommended test repos:**
- **Small:** Simple CRUD app, starter template
- **Medium:** ✅ omnara (done), Next.js SaaS app
- **Large:** Kubernetes, React, large monorepo

**2. Modification Type Coverage (10 types)**

Test all modification types from Phase 0:

| Type | Example Change | Expected Detection | Tested? |
|------|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| Security | Auth code + keywords | CRITICAL, force escalate | ✅ Yes (omnara) |
| Docs-only | README, comments | LOW, skip analysis | Need test |
| Config | .env, feature flags | HIGH, force escalate | Need test |
| Structural | Refactoring, imports | LOW-MEDIUM | Need test |
| Behavioral | Logic changes | MEDIUM-HIGH | Need test |
| Interface | API, schema | HIGH | Need test |
| Testing | Add tests | LOW | Need test |
| Temporal | High churn files | MEDIUM-HIGH | Need test |
| Ownership | New contributor | MEDIUM | Need test |
| Performance | Caching, concurrency | MEDIUM | Need test |

**3. False Positive Validation**

Run CodeRisk on known-safe changes to measure FP rate:

- Pure refactoring (no logic change)
- Documentation updates
- Test additions
- Code formatting
- Comment changes

**Target:** <3% false positive rate

**4. Integration Tests**

You have existing test scripts - run them:

```bash
# In coderisk-go repo:
./test/integration/test_check_e2e.sh
./test/integration/test_init_e2e.sh
./test/integration/test_temporal_analysis.sh
./test/integration/modification_type_tests/run_all_tests.sh
./test/e2e/regression_tests.sh
```

### Testing Prompt for Omnara Repo Session

See: [TESTING_PROMPT_OMNARA.md](#testing-prompt-file-below)

---

## Cloud Deployment (Future)

**Current:** Local mode only (Docker + Neo4j)

**Future (Phase 2):** Cloud mode
- We host Neptune (no Docker needed)
- Pre-built public cache (React, Next.js instant access)
- Team collaboration (shared graphs)
- Webhooks (auto-update on push)

**Timeline:** 8-12 weeks (per ADR-006)

**For now:** Focus on local mode being rock-solid

## Summary of Corrections

### V1 Mistakes:
1. ❌ Said Phase 0 works standalone (wrong - it's just a pre-filter)
2. ❌ Said Docker is "optional" (wrong - graph is required)
3. ❌ Showed "Free tier" (wrong - costs $0.03-0.05/check minimum)

### V2 Corrections:
1. ✅ Phase 0 is pre-filter, not standalone
2. ✅ Docker + init-local is REQUIRED for graph
3. ✅ Minimum cost: $3-5/month (100 checks, BYOK)
4. ✅ Setup time: 17 minutes one-time per repo
5. ✅ Both API key + graph database required

---

## Next Steps

1. **Verify this correction** - Does this match your understanding?
2. **Continue omnara testing** - Use testing prompt below
3. **Update all docs** - Once verified, update 7 doc files
4. **Test on more repos** - Small and large repos for validation

AI-powered code risk assessment that catches risky changes before they reach production. Sub-5-second analysis using graph-based knowledge and LLM intelligence.

## Installation

CodeRisk supports multiple installation methods for maximum flexibility.

### Homebrew (Recommended for macOS/Linux)

```bash
# Install via Homebrew
brew tap rohankatakam/coderisk
brew install crisk

# Verify installation
crisk --version
```

### Install Script (Universal One-Liner)

Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://coderisk.dev/install.sh | bash
```

The script will:
- Auto-detect your platform (OS + architecture)
- Download the latest release
- Verify checksums
- Install to `~/.local/bin/crisk`
- Prompt for OpenAI API key setup (interactive)

### Docker

For containerized workflows and CI/CD:

```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull coderisk/crisk:latest

# Run a check
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/repo coderisk/crisk:latest check

# With API key
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/repo \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..." \
  coderisk/crisk:latest check --explain
```

### Direct Download

Download pre-built binaries from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/rohankatakam/coderisk-go/releases):

1. Download the appropriate archive for your platform
2. Extract the binary: `tar -xzf crisk_*.tar.gz`
3. Move to PATH: `mv crisk ~/.local/bin/` (or `/usr/local/bin` with sudo)
4. Make executable: `chmod +x ~/.local/bin/crisk`

### Build from Source

If you prefer to build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohankatakam/coderisk-go.git
cd coderisk-go
go build -o crisk ./cmd/crisk
mv crisk ~/.local/bin/
```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **OpenAI API key** (REQUIRED): Get one at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- **Docker Desktop** (REQUIRED): For graph database (Neo4j)
- Git repository to analyze

### Setup (17 minutes one-time per repo)

```bash
# 1. Configure API key (if not done during installation)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc for persistence

# 2. Start infrastructure (2 minutes)
docker compose up -d

# 3. Initialize repository (10-15 minutes)
cd /path/to/your/repo
crisk init-local
# Builds graph: Tree-sitter AST + Git history

# 4. Check for risks (2-5 seconds)
crisk check
```

**Setup time:** ~17 minutes (one-time per repo)
**Check time:** 2-5 seconds (after setup)
**Cost:** $0.03-0.05/check (BYOK)

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Check changed files for risk
crisk check

# Check specific files with detailed explanation
crisk check --explain path/to/file.go

# Install pre-commit hook for automatic checks
crisk hook install

# View repository status
crisk status
```

### AI-Powered Analysis

CodeRisk uses LLM-guided agentic investigation for risk assessment:

```bash
# Baseline check with detailed explanation
crisk check --explain path/to/file.go

# JSON output for AI tools (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
crisk check --ai-mode path/to/file.go
```

> **IMPORTANT:** Both OpenAI API key AND graph database (Docker + init-local) are **REQUIRED** for CodeRisk to function.
>
> ```bash
> # Set API key
> export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."  # Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
>
> # Start graph database
> docker compose up -d
>
> # Initialize repository
> crisk init-local
> ```

### View Graph Data

Open Neo4j Browser at http://localhost:7475

- **Username:** `neo4j`
- **Password:** `CHANGE_THIS_PASSWORD_IN_PRODUCTION_123`

Try these queries:

```cypher
-- See all nodes by type
MATCH (n) RETURN labels(n)[0] as type, count(n) ORDER BY count DESC

-- Find high-coupling files
MATCH (f:File)-[:IMPORTS]->()
WITH f, count(*) as imports
WHERE imports > 10
RETURN f.name, imports ORDER BY imports DESC LIMIT 10
```

## How It Works

**Phase 0: Pre-Filter (<50ms)**
- Security keyword detection (auto-escalate)
- Docs-only changes (skip expensive analysis)
- Configuration file detection

**Phase 1: Baseline Assessment (1-2s)**
- Graph queries for 1-hop neighbors
- Structural coupling analysis
- Initial risk score calculation

**Phase 2: Deep Investigation (2-5s)**
- LLM-guided agentic graph navigation (3-5 hops)
- Temporal coupling detection (CO_CHANGED patterns)
- Evidence synthesis from code structure, git history, and past incidents
- Confidence-driven stopping (stops at 85%)

**Result:** <3% false positive rate (vs 10-20% industry standard)

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# REQUIRED for CodeRisk to function
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

Add to your shell config for persistence:
```bash
# For zsh
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# For bash
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Optional Configuration

For advanced configuration:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env for custom ports, memory limits, etc.
```

Optional settings:
- `NEO4J_PASSWORD` - Change default database password
- Port mappings if defaults conflict (7687, 7474, 5432, 6379)
- Memory limits for Docker containers

## Development

### Build Requirements

CodeRisk uses tree-sitter for AST parsing, which requires CGO and a C compiler:

**macOS:**
```bash
# Xcode Command Line Tools (includes gcc)
xcode-select --install
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

**Linux (Alpine/Docker):**
```bash
apk add gcc musl-dev
```

> **Why CGO?** Tree-sitter language parsers are C libraries with Go bindings for performance.

### Quick Start for Contributors

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rohankatakam/coderisk-go.git
cd coderisk-go

# One-command setup (build + start services + install)
make dev

# Verify installation
crisk --version
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Build CLI binary
make build

# Quick rebuild and reinstall (fast iteration)
make rebuild

# Run tests
make test

# Format and lint code
make fmt
make lint

# Clean database (keeps containers)
make clean-db

# Complete cleanup
make clean-all

# Fresh clone state (removes all local data)
make clean-fresh
```

### Docker Services

```bash
# Start services (Neo4j, PostgreSQL, Redis)
make start

# Check service status
make status

# View logs
make logs

# Stop services
make stop
```

### Common Workflows

**Quick Development:**
```bash
# Make code changes...
make rebuild              # Rebuild and reinstall
crisk check <file>        # Test your changes
```

**Clean Development:**
```bash
make clean-all           # Clean everything
make build              # Build fresh
make start              # Start services
make install-global     # Install globally
```

**Database Issues:**
```bash
make clean-db           # Reset database
make start              # Restart services
```

## Executive Summary

This document outlines CodeRisk's strategy to build **4 durable competitive moats** based on Hamilton Helmer's "7 Powers" framework:

1. **Cornered Resource:** The ARC Database (CVE for Architecture) - **Bootstrap via GitHub mining (8 weeks, $250)**
2. **Counter-Positioning:** Trust Infrastructure for AI Code (not analysis tool)
3. **Network Effects:** Cross-Organization Pattern Learning - **Bootstrapped by GitHub data**
4. **Brand:** "First ARC Database" category creation - **First-mover advantage**

**Strategic Imperative:** Transform from "pre-commit analysis tool" to **"Trust Infrastructure for AI-Generated Code"**

**Bootstrap Strategy:** Mine 10,000 GitHub incidents → Create 100 ARC entries → Launch as **first public ARC database** (3-5 year competitive advantage)

---

## Power #1: Cornered Resource - The Incident Knowledge Graph

### Vision: "CVE for Architecture"

Create the world's largest, authoritative database of **architectural risks and incidents** - the missing layer between code vulnerabilities (CVE) and production incidents.

### 1.1: Public Incident Database (ARC Catalog)

**Concept:** Like CVE (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures) but for architectural coupling risks.

**Structure:**
```
ARC-2025-001: "Auth + User Service Temporal Coupling"
  Title: Authentication changes without user service integration tests
  Pattern Signature: [graph-hash-fingerprint]
  Severity: HIGH (4.2 hours avg downtime)
  Observed: 47 incidents across 23 companies
  First Reported: 2025-03-15
  Last Updated: 2025-10-04

  Description:
    When authentication logic changes without corresponding integration
    tests for user service, temporal coupling causes cascade failures.

  Affected Patterns:
    - Auth service modifies token validation
    - User service still expects old token format
    - No integration test coverage between services

  Mitigation:
    1. Add integration tests for auth + user service
    2. Use contract testing (Pact, Spring Cloud Contract)
    3. Implement circuit breaker pattern
    4. Add monitoring for auth token validation failures

  Related Incidents:
    - INC-453 (Company A): Auth timeout cascade
    - INC-789 (Company B): Token validation mismatch
    - ... (45 more verified incidents)

  Verified By: CodeRisk (crowd-sourced from 23 organizations)
```

**Key Features:**

**Public API:**
```bash
# Search for patterns before committing
curl https://api.coderisk.com/v1/arc/search \
  -d "pattern_signature=auth-user-coupling-v1"

# Response:
{
  "arc_id": "ARC-2025-001",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "incident_count": 47,
  "mitigation_steps": [...],
  "similar_incidents": [...]
}
```

**Integration with crisk CLI:**
```bash
crisk check

⚠️ HIGH risk detected:

Pattern matches known architectural risks:
  - ARC-2025-001: Auth + User Service Coupling (47 incidents)
  - ARC-2025-034: Payment + Database Temporal Coupling (23 incidents)

Your change is 91% similar to ARC-2025-001
Historical outcome: 89% incident rate within 7 days

Recommended actions:
  1. Add integration tests (see ARC-2025-001 mitigation)
  2. Review coupling with user_service.py
  3. Consider circuit breaker pattern
```

**Crowd-Sourced Data Collection:**
```bash
# Companies submit incidents (anonymized)
crisk incident submit \
  --title "Auth timeout cascade" \
  --pattern-signature [auto-detected] \
  --severity HIGH \
  --mitigation "Added integration tests"

# CodeRisk verifies and assigns ARC ID
# If pattern matches existing ARC → increment count
# If new pattern → create new ARC entry
```

**Governance Model:**
- CodeRisk Foundation (non-profit, like MITRE for CVE)
- Community review board (10 companies)
- Quarterly ARC review meetings
- Public submission process (GitHub-style)

**Business Model:**
- **Free:** Public ARC database (SEO, brand building)
- **Paid:** Private incident linking for companies
- **Enterprise:** Custom ARC reports for architecture reviews
- **Consulting:** ARC remediation services

**Strategic Moat:**
- First-mover: Define the standard (like MITRE for CVE)
- Network effect: More incidents = more valuable database
- Switching cost: Competitors start from zero
- Brand: "Verified by CodeRisk" = authoritative source

**Target Metrics (Updated with GitHub Mining Bootstrap):**

| Metric | Original Target | GitHub Mining Boost | Updated Timeline |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **ARC Entries** | 100 (12 months) | 100 (8 weeks) | ✅ **8 weeks** (10x faster) |
| **Incidents Cataloged** | 10,000 (12 months) | 10,000 (2 weeks) | ✅ **2 weeks** (bootstrap) |
| **Data Sources** | 50 companies (12 months) | 1,000 repos (8 weeks) | ✅ **8 weeks** (then add companies) |
| **API Queries** | 100K/month (12 months) | N/A | 3-6 months (post-launch) |

**Bootstrap Strategy:** See [reality_gap_github_mining_strategy.md](../04-research/active/reality_gap_github_mining_strategy.md) for execution plan

---

### 1.2: Automatic Incident Attribution System

**Concept:** Build the only database linking **commits → deployments → incidents → root causes**.

**Architecture:**

**Phase 1: Monitoring Integration**
```yaml
# Integrations (launch order):
1. Datadog / New Relic (APM + logs)
2. Sentry / Rollbar (error tracking)
3. PagerDuty / Opsgenie (incident management)
4. Kubernetes / CloudWatch (infrastructure)

# How it works:
Incident detected (Datadog alert)
→ CodeRisk traces back to deployment
→ Maps deployment to commits (git SHA)
→ Runs CodeRisk analysis on those commits
→ Builds causal graph: Commit → Risk → Deploy → Incident
```

**Phase 2: Automatic Pattern Detection**
```python
# Example: Incident detected
incident = {
  "id": "INC-2025-1043",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-04T14:32:00Z",
  "service": "auth-service",
  "error": "Timeout connecting to user-service",
  "deploy_sha": "abc1234"
}

# CodeRisk automatically:
1. Fetches commit abc1234
2. Runs graph analysis (which files changed?)
3. Calculates pattern signature (auth.py + user_service.py)
4. Searches ARC database for similar patterns
5. Finds: ARC-2025-001 (91% similarity)
6. Links incident to ARC, increments counter
7. Notifies team: "This matches known pattern ARC-2025-001"
```

**Phase 3: Predictive Incident Prevention**
```bash
# Developer commits code
git commit -m "Update auth token validation"

# Pre-commit hook runs
crisk check

🔴 CRITICAL risk detected:

This change is 94% similar to past incidents:
  - ARC-2025-001 (47 incidents, 89% within 7 days)
  - Your team's INC-453 (2025-09-15)
  - Company X's INC-789 (2025-08-10)

Predictive analysis:
  - 87% probability of incident within 7 days
  - Estimated impact: 4.2 hours downtime
  - Estimated cost: $12,000 (based on your SLA)

Automatic mitigation available:
  → crisk fix-with-ai --arc ARC-2025-001
  → Applies known mitigation from 47 previous incidents
```

**Data Privacy Model:**
- Incident metadata stored (timestamp, service, error type)
- **NO source code stored** (only graph signatures)
- Pattern fingerprints are one-way hashes
- Federated learning (pattern extraction on-device)
- Opt-in data sharing (companies control anonymization)

**Strategic Moat:**
- **Unique dataset:** No competitor has commit→incident causal data
- **Network effect:** More incidents = better predictions
- **Time moat:** Requires 5-10 years of usage to build from scratch
- **Lock-in:** Companies can't switch (lose incident knowledge)

**Target Metrics (12 months):**
- 10,000 incidents auto-attributed to commits
- 5,000 incidents linked to ARC patterns
- 85% predictive accuracy (incident within 7 days)
- 100 companies opted in to data sharing

---

### 1.3: Cross-Organization Pattern Learning (Privacy-Preserving)

**Concept:** Learn architectural patterns across organizations **without sharing code**.

**Problem Today:**
```
Company A (Fintech): Discovers "auth + payment coupling" causes incidents
→ Knowledge stays siloed in Company A

Company B (E-commerce): Makes same mistake
→ Re-discovers same pattern the hard way (production incident)

Company C (SaaS): Makes same mistake again
→ Industry keeps repeating same errors
```

**Solution: Federated Pattern Learning**

**Architecture:**

**Step 1: Pattern Extraction (On-Device)**
```python
# Runs in customer's VPC (no data leaves network)
class PatternExtractor:
    def extract_signature(self, commit):
        # Analyze graph structure
        files_changed = commit.files
        temporal_coupling = analyze_co_change_patterns(files_changed)
        graph_signature = hash_graph_structure(files_changed, temporal_coupling)

        # One-way hash (cannot reverse to source code)
        pattern_fingerprint = sha256(graph_signature + salt)

        # Metadata only (no code)
        return {
            "fingerprint": pattern_fingerprint,
            "language": "python",
            "coupling_strength": 0.85,
            "incident_occurred": True,
            "severity": "HIGH",
            "context": "auth-service"  # generic label
        }
```

**Step 2: Pattern Aggregation (CodeRisk Cloud)**
```python
# CodeRisk aggregates patterns across orgs
class PatternMatcher:
    def match_patterns(self, new_fingerprint):
        # Find similar patterns from other orgs
        similar = db.query("""
            SELECT fingerprint, incident_count, severity
            FROM pattern_knowledge_graph
            WHERE similarity(fingerprint, :new) > 0.85
        """, new=new_fingerprint)

        # Return aggregated insights (no code, no company names)
        return {
            "matched_pattern": "auth-coupling-v1",
            "observed_at": "23 companies",
            "incident_count": 47,
            "avg_severity": "HIGH",
            "mitigation_success_rate": 0.92
        }
```

**Step 3: Prediction (Real-Time)**
```bash
# Developer at Company D makes similar change
crisk check

⚠️ Pattern detected from industry knowledge:

This architectural pattern has been observed at 23 companies:
  - 47 incidents recorded
  - 89% incident rate within 7 days
  - HIGH severity (avg 4.2 hours downtime)

Your change matches known risky pattern (91% similarity)

Successful mitigation from other companies:
  1. Add integration tests (92% success rate)
  2. Use circuit breaker (87% success rate)
  3. Implement contract testing (78% success rate)

→ No company names disclosed (privacy-preserving)
→ Your code never left your network
→ You benefit from 23 companies' learnings
```

**Privacy Guarantees:**
- **No source code transmitted:** Only graph fingerprints (one-way hashes)
- **No company identification:** Aggregated stats only ("23 companies")
- **Federated learning:** Pattern extraction happens in customer VPC
- **Differential privacy:** Noise added to prevent re-identification
- **Opt-in:** Companies control what patterns are shared

**Technical Implementation:**
```yaml
# .crisk/config.yml
privacy:
  federated_learning: true  # Extract patterns locally
  share_patterns: true      # Contribute to industry knowledge
  differential_privacy: true # Add noise to prevent re-identification

  # What gets shared:
  share_anonymized_patterns: true   # Graph fingerprints only
  share_incident_outcomes: true     # Did it cause incident? (yes/no)
  share_mitigation_results: true    # Did fix work? (yes/no)

  # What NEVER gets shared:
  share_source_code: false          # NEVER
  share_company_name: false         # NEVER
  share_file_names: false           # NEVER
```

**Strategic Moat:**
- **Network effect:** More companies = better predictions (exponential value)
- **Data moat:** Largest cross-industry architectural pattern database
- **Privacy moat:** Federated learning = unique trust model
- **Switching cost:** Leaving CodeRisk = losing industry knowledge

**Competitive Advantage:**
```
CodeRisk: 23 companies contributing → 47 incidents learned
Competitor A: Starts from zero → no historical data
Competitor B: Tries to build → can't get companies to share (no trust)

Result: CodeRisk has 5-10 year data advantage
```

**Target Metrics (12 months):**
- 100 companies opted in to pattern sharing
- 500 unique pattern signatures identified
- 10,000 cross-company pattern matches
- 85% prediction accuracy using federated learning

## Power #2: Counter-Positioning - Trust Infrastructure for AI Code

### Vision: "The Trust Layer for AI-Generated Code"

**Strategic Shift:** From "analysis tool" to "trust infrastructure"

**Why Counter-Positioning?**
```
Old Model (ours today):
→ Developer tool, usage-based pricing
→ Competitors can copy features
→ SonarQube/GitHub can add pre-commit mode

New Model (proposed):
→ Trust infrastructure, platform play
→ Fundamentally different business model
→ Competitors CANNOT copy without destroying existing revenue
```

### 2.1: AI Code Provenance & Verification

**Concept:** Every AI-generated code block gets a "Trust Certificate"

**How it works:**

**Step 1: AI Generation (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot)**
```python
# Claude Code generates code
code = claude_generate("Add payment processing with Stripe")

# Before presenting to user, get trust certificate
cert = coderisk.verify(code, context={
    "files_changed": ["payment.py", "stripe_client.py"],
    "ai_tool": "claude-code-v1.0",
    "risk_factors": ["payment_handling", "external_api"]
})

# Certificate response:
{
    "certificate_id": "CERT-2025-abc123",
    "risk_score": 3.2,  # 0-10 scale
    "risk_level": "LOW",
    "confidence": 0.94,
    "ai_tool": "claude-code-v1.0",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-04T14:32:00Z",
    "checks_passed": [
        "test_coverage: 78%",
        "no_security_issues",
        "coupling_score: 4/10",
        "no_incident_similarity"
    ],
    "signature": "SHA256:abc123...",  # Cryptographic signature
    "verified_by": "coderisk-v1.0"
}
```

**Step 2: Display to User (with Trust Badge)**
```bash
# What developer sees in Claude Code:
> I've added Stripe payment processing.

Files created:
- payment.py (150 lines)
- stripe_client.py (80 lines)
- tests/test_payment.py (120 lines)

**Step 4: Audit Trail (Immutable Record)**
```bash
# Anyone can verify certificate
curl https://api.coderisk.com/v1/certs/CERT-2025-abc123

# Response (public, immutable):

    "risk_score": 3.2,
    "checks": [...],
    "signature": "SHA256:abc123...",
    "blockchain_hash": "0x789def...",  # Optional: Ethereum/IPFS
    "status": "valid"
}
```

**Business Model:**
- **Free:** Basic trust verification (individual developers)
- **Paid:** Trust certificates for teams ($0.05/cert)
- **Enterprise:** Private trust infrastructure ($5K/month)
- **Platform:** AI tool vendors pay for "Verified by CodeRisk" badges ($10K/year)

**Strategic Moat:**
- **Neutral arbiter:** CodeRisk has no conflict of interest (unlike GitHub/SonarQube)
- **Business model:** Platform play competitors can't copy
- **Brand:** "CodeRisk Verified" = quality signal (like "ISO 9001")

### 2.2: AI Code Insurance (Underwrite the Risk)

**Concept:** Guarantee AI-generated code quality. If incident occurs, CodeRisk pays.

**Product: "CodeRisk-Insured AI Code"**

**How it works:**

**Step 1: Generate & Verify**
```bash
# Developer uses Claude Code to generate payment feature
> "Add Stripe payment processing with fraud detection"

# Claude generates code, CodeRisk analyzes
crisk check --insure

🔍 Analyzing for insurance eligibility...

Risk Assessment:
  - Risk Score: 2.8/10 (LOW)
  - Confidence: 96%
  - Test Coverage: 82%
  - Security: No issues
  - Incident Similarity: 0 matches

✅ ELIGIBLE FOR INSURANCE

Insurance Coverage:
  - Premium: $0.10/check (vs $0.01 standard)
  - Coverage: 30 days
  - Max Payout: $5,000 SLA credits
  - Incident Definition: Production outage >15 min

Do you want to insure this code? (y/N): y

🔐 Insurance Certificate Issued: INS-2025-xyz789
   Coverage Period: 2025-10-04 to 2025-11-03
   Policy: $5K coverage, $0.10 premium
```

**Step 2: Deploy & Monitor**
```bash
# Code deployed to production
git push origin main

# CodeRisk monitors (via Datadog integration)
# If incident occurs within 30 days:

🚨 Incident Detected: INC-2025-1087
   Service: payment-service
   Error: Stripe API timeout
   Duration: 47 minutes
   Root Cause: Missing circuit breaker (commit abc123)

📋 Insurance Claim Auto-Filed:
   Policy: INS-2025-xyz789
   Incident: INC-2025-1087
   Affected Commit: abc123 (insured)
   Downtime: 47 minutes
   SLA Impact: $2,100

⏳ Claim under review (24-48 hours)
```

**Step 3: Claim Processing**
```bash
# CodeRisk reviews claim (automated + human review)

Claim Review: INS-2025-xyz789
  ✅ Incident verified (Datadog logs)
  ✅ Root cause linked to insured commit (abc123)
  ✅ Within coverage period (23 days remaining)
  ✅ Coverage limit not exceeded ($2,100 < $5,000)

Claim Status: APPROVED

Payout: $2,100 SLA credits
  - Credited to your CodeRisk account
  - Can be used for future checks, insurance, or cashed out

Incident Analysis:
  - Root cause: Missing circuit breaker for Stripe API
  - Similar patterns: ARC-2025-045 (11 incidents)
  - Recommendation: Add circuit breaker (93% success rate)
```

**Pricing Model:**
```yaml
Standard Check: $0.01 (no insurance)
Insured Check: $0.10 (10x premium)

Economics:
  - 98% of insured checks pass → no incident
  - 2% have incidents → avg payout $2,000
  - Break-even: $0.10 × 50 = $5 revenue, $2 × 0.02 = $0.04 cost
  - Profit margin: 60% on insurance product

Coverage Tiers:
  - Basic: $5K max payout ($0.10/check)
  - Pro: $25K max payout ($0.25/check)
  - Enterprise: $100K max payout ($0.50/check)
```

**Risk Management:**
- **Underwriting:** Only insure LOW/MEDIUM risk (score <5/10)
- **Actuarial model:** Based on 10K+ historical incidents
- **Reinsurance:** Partner with actual insurance companies (for large payouts)
- **Claim limits:** Max 3 claims per month per team

**Why This is Counter-Positioning:**
```
SonarQube: Cannot offer insurance
  → Pure software company, no balance sheet
  → No actuarial expertise
  → Cannot underwrite risk

GitHub: Cannot offer insurance
  → Conflict of interest (they host the code)
  → Would be insuring their own infrastructure
  → Legal/compliance nightmare

CodeRisk: Can offer because:
  → Neutral third party (no conflict)
  → Historical incident data (actuarial model)
  → Predictive accuracy (<3% FP rate)
  → Insurance partner network (reinsurance)

Result: CodeRisk has monopoly on AI code insurance
```

**Strategic Moat:**
- **Unique business model:** No competitor can copy (requires underwriting)
- **Ultimate switching cost:** Losing insurance coverage
- **Data moat:** Requires 10K+ incidents for actuarial model
- **Brand:** "The only AI code tool you can bet money on"

**Target Metrics (12 months):**
- $100K insurance premium revenue
- 1,000 insured code deployments
- 20 claims processed (2% claim rate)
- $40K total payouts ($2K avg per claim)
- 60% profit margin on insurance product

---

### 2.3: AI Tool Reputation System

**Concept:** Create public leaderboard of AI tool quality (measured by CodeRisk).

**"AI Code Trust Scores" - Public Rankings**

**How it works:**

**Step 1: Continuous Measurement**
```python
# CodeRisk tracks every AI-generated code block
class AIToolMetrics:
    def track_generation(self, ai_tool, code, outcome):
        metrics = {
            "tool": ai_tool,  # "claude-code-v1.0"
            "risk_score": calculate_risk(code),
            "test_coverage": calculate_coverage(code),
            "incident_occurred": outcome == "incident",
            "time_to_incident": days_until_incident,
        }

        db.insert("ai_tool_metrics", metrics)

# Aggregate monthly
monthly_scores = db.query("""
    SELECT
        tool,
        AVG(risk_score) as avg_risk,
        AVG(test_coverage) as avg_coverage,
        SUM(incident_occurred) / COUNT(*) as incident_rate
    FROM ai_tool_metrics
    WHERE generated_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
    GROUP BY tool
""")
```

**Step 2: Public Leaderboard (coderisk.com/ai-tools)**

Scoring Criteria:
  - Risk Score (40%): Avg risk level of generated code
  - Test Coverage (30%): Avg test coverage of generated code
  - Incident Rate (30%): % of code causing production incidents
```

**Step 3: AI Tool Integration (Arms Race)**
```python
# AI tool vendors optimize for CodeRisk scores

# Example: Claude Code internally
class ClaudeCodeGenerator:
    def generate_code(self, prompt):
        # Generate initial code
        code = llm.generate(prompt)

        # Pre-check with CodeRisk API
        score = coderisk.check(code)

        # If score too low, regenerate
        if score.risk_level > "MEDIUM":
            # Add tests, reduce coupling, fix issues
            code = self.improve_code(code, score.recommendations)

        # Return CodeRisk-optimized code
        return code

# Result: AI tools compete to top the leaderboard
→ Claude: "We have highest CodeRisk score (96/100)"
→ Cursor: "We just beat Claude (97/100)"
→ Copilot: "New model optimized for CodeRisk (98/100)"
→ Arms race benefits CodeRisk (more integration, more data)
```

**Step 4: Marketing & Brand**
```markdown
# AI Tool Landing Pages (using CodeRisk badge)

[See Full Report →](https://coderisk.com/tools/claude-code)
```

**Business Model:**
- **Free:** Basic leaderboard (public data)
- **Paid:** "CodeRisk Verified" badge for AI tools ($10K/year)
- **Enterprise:** Private benchmarking for internal AI tools ($50K/year)
- **Consulting:** Help AI tools improve scores ($100K engagements)

**Strategic Moat:**
- **Network effect:** More AI tools = more valuable rankings
- **Brand:** "CodeRisk Score" = industry standard (like G2, TrustRadius)
- **Data moat:** AI tools need CodeRisk data to improve
- **Platform power:** CodeRisk becomes required infrastructure

**Why Competitors Can't Copy:**
```
GitHub: Conflict of interest (they have Copilot)
  → Can't fairly rank their own tool vs competitors
  → No neutral arbiter credibility

SonarQube: Only does static analysis
  → Can't measure incident rates (no runtime data)
  → Can't link code → incidents

CodeRisk: Neutral + has incident data
  → No dog in the AI tool race
  → Unique incident attribution database
  → Trusted arbiter position
```

**Target Metrics (12 months):**
- 10 AI tools ranked on leaderboard
- 500K AI-generated code blocks analyzed
- 5 AI tool vendors paying for "Verified" badge
- 100K monthly visitors to AI tool rankings page
- 3 AI tool vendor consulting engagements

## Power #3: Network Effects - Cross-Organization Learning

### Vision: "The More Companies Use CodeRisk, The Smarter It Gets For Everyone"

**Current Network Effect (Limited):**
- Public repos: Shared cache (instant access to React, Next.js)
- Team sharing: One graph per team
- **Problem:** Isolated to public repos, no cross-org learning

**New Network Effect (Exponential):**
- Cross-company pattern learning (privacy-preserving)
- Industry-wide incident database (CVE for Architecture)
- Federated learning (no code leaves VPC)

### 3.1: Network Effect Flywheel

**Virtuous Cycle:**
```
Company A discovers risky pattern
→ Anonymously contributes to CodeRisk knowledge graph
→ CodeRisk learns: "auth + user service coupling = HIGH risk"

Company B makes similar change (different codebase)
→ CodeRisk: "⚠️ This pattern caused incidents at 23 companies"
→ Company B avoids incident (fixes proactively)

Company C benefits from A + B's learnings
→ CodeRisk gets smarter (more data)
→ Company C sees even better predictions

→ Network effect: More companies = exponentially smarter tool

Company D joins CodeRisk
→ Sees value immediately (learns from 100+ companies)
→ Low switching cost for D to join
→ High switching cost for A/B/C to leave (lose network)

→ Winner-take-most dynamics
```

**Quantitative Model:**
```
Value to Company N = f(total_companies, total_incidents)

V(N) = log(C) × sqrt(I)

Where:
  C = total companies in network
  I = total incidents in knowledge graph

Example:
  10 companies, 1K incidents:  V = log(10) × sqrt(1000) = 1.0 × 31.6 = 31.6
  100 companies, 10K incidents: V = log(100) × sqrt(10000) = 2.0 × 100 = 200
  1000 companies, 100K incidents: V = log(1000) × sqrt(100000) = 3.0 × 316 = 948

→ 10x companies, 100x incidents = 30x value (exponential)
→ Network effects create winner-take-most market
```

### 3.2: "AI Code Trust Score" - Public Team Ratings

**Concept:** Public score showing team's AI code quality (verified by CodeRisk).

**How it works:**

**Step 1: Calculate Team Score**
```python
team_score = {
    "team": "Acme Corp - Backend Team",
    "ai_code_percentage": 0.67,  # 67% of code AI-generated
    "total_commits": 10000,
    "ai_commits": 6700,
    "risk_distribution": {
        "LOW": 0.82,    # 82% low risk
        "MEDIUM": 0.15, # 15% medium risk
        "HIGH": 0.03    # 3% high risk
    },
    "incident_rate": 0.012,  # 1.2% incident rate
    "test_coverage": 0.78,   # 78% avg coverage
    "grade": "A+",
    "score": 96
}
```

**Step 2: Public Badge (GitHub README, Company Website)**
```markdown
# Acme Corp Backend Services

[![AI Code Trust Score](https://img.shields.io/badge/CodeRisk-A+-success)](https://coderisk.com/teams/acme-backend)

**CodeRisk Verified:**
- AI Code Grade: A+ (96/100)
- 67% AI-generated code
- 1.2% incident rate (industry avg: 3.4%)
- 78% test coverage

*Based on 10,000 commits analyzed by CodeRisk*
```

```

**Step 4: Network Effects**
```
Developer job search:
→ "I want to work on a team with A+ AI Code Trust Score"
→ Acme Corp recruits: "We have A+ CodeRisk score (top 3%)"

Companies compete:
→ "Our team has B+ score, we need to improve to A+"
→ Invest in CodeRisk, better practices, AI tooling
→ Public competition drives adoption

New teams:
→ "We just formed, no score yet (Unrated)"
→ Need CodeRisk to build score (day 1 adoption)

→ Network effect: Everyone wants high score
→ CodeRisk becomes required (like credit scores)
```

**Privacy Controls:**
```yaml
# .crisk/config.yml
trust_score:
  public: true           # Show score publicly
  badge_enabled: true    # Allow badge on GitHub
  leaderboard: true      # Appear on leaderboard
  team_name: "Acme Backend Team"

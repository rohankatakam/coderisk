# System Architecture Documentation

**Purpose:** Core system design, technical architecture, design decisions

> **ðŸ“˜ For AI agents:** Before creating/updating architecture docs, read [DOCUMENTATION_WORKFLOW.md](../DOCUMENTATION_WORKFLOW.md) to determine if this is the right location and which document to update.

## Document Guidelines

### When to Add Here
- System design proposals
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Technical deep-dives
- Component specifications

### When NOT to Add Here
- Implementation guides (goes to 03-implementation/)
- Operational procedures (goes to 02-operations/)
- Business requirements (goes to 00-product/)

### Format
- **High-level** - Concepts and decisions, not code
- **Decision-focused** - What we chose and why
- **Timeless** - Avoid implementation details that change frequently

---

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs are stored in the `decisions/` subdirectory and numbered sequentially.

**When to write an ADR:**
- Significant technology choice (database, framework, language)
- Architectural pattern adoption
- Security or scalability decision
- Trade-off between competing approaches

**ADR Naming:**
- Format: `NNN-short-title.md` (e.g., `001-neptune-over-neo4j.md`)
- Number sequentially starting from 001
- Use lowercase with hyphens

**See:** [decisions/README.md](decisions/README.md) for ADR template

## Key Concepts

### Cloud-First Architecture
- BYOK (Bring Your Own API Key) model
- Amazon Neptune Serverless for graphs
- Kubernetes for compute orchestration
- PostgreSQL for metadata
- Redis for caching

### Graph Ontology
- Five layers: Syntactic, Semantic, Behavioral, Risk, Causal
- Dense graphs (50-200 relationships per entity)
- Temporal coupling from git history
- Incident correlation

### Agentic Investigation
- **Three-phase architecture:** Phase 0 pre-analysis â†’ Phase 1 baseline â†’ Phase 2 confidence-driven investigation
- **Adaptive thresholds:** Domain-aware configs (Python web vs Go backend)
- **Confidence-based stopping:** Dynamic hop count (1-5) based on evidence quality
- **Hybrid ARC patterns:** Combine complementary patterns for 3-5x better insights
- **Metric validation:** Auto-exclude metrics with >3% FP rate
- **Evidence-based reasoning:** LLM synthesizes from multiple low-FP signals

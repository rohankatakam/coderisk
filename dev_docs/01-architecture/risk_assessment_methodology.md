# Risk Assessment Methodology

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** October 5, 2025
**Purpose:** High-level design of risk calculation logic for code change assessment
**Design Philosophy:** Simple, robust metrics with low false-positive rates, not complex statistical models *(12-factor: Factor 3 - Own your context window)*

---

## 1. Core Principles

### 1.1. Design Philosophy

**Simplified Approach (Current):**
- ✅ **Factual metrics** - Coupling counts, co-change frequencies (1-5% FP rate)
- ✅ **Evidence-based reasoning** - LLM synthesizes multiple low-FP signals
- ✅ **Selective calculation** - Only compute what the investigation needs
- ✅ **Self-validating** - Track FP rates, auto-disable metrics >3% FP threshold

**Deprecated Approach (Legacy):**
- ❌ **Complex statistical models** - ΔDBR, HDCC, G² Surprise (10-25% FP rate)
- ❌ **Pre-computed risk scores** - Stale, context-unaware
- ❌ **Exhaustive metric sets** - 9+ metrics per check (expensive, noisy)

**Why the Shift:**
- Legacy models had **15-25% false positive rates** due to over-fitting on historical patterns
- Complex math (PPR deltas, Hawkes decay) added **marginal value** (<5% accuracy improvement) at **high cost** ($15 init + $5/day)
- Simple metrics are **factual** (coupling is observable) vs. **statistical** (surprise is inferred)

### 1.2. Two-Tier Metric System

**Tier 1: Always Calculate (High Signal, Low Cost)**
- Structural coupling (1-hop dependency count)
- Temporal co-change (pre-computed edge weights)
- Test coverage ratio (test file relationships)
- **Characteristics:** <200ms total, <3% FP rate, 100% cache hit rate

**Tier 2: Calculate on LLM Request (Context-Dependent)**
- Ownership churn (git history analysis)
- Incident similarity (BM25 text search only, no vector embeddings)
- **Characteristics:** <500ms total, 5-12% FP rate, 70-90% cache hit rate

**Tier 3: Explicitly Avoided (High FP or Expensive)**
- ΔDBR (Diffusion Blast Radius) - 15-20% FP rate, $0.50+ per check
- HDCC (Hawkes Decay Co-Change) - 12-18% FP rate, complex decay modeling
- G² Surprise (Dunning Log-Likelihood) - 20-25% FP rate, statistical noise
- Vector embeddings for incident matching - Marginal improvement over BM25, 10x cost

---

## 2. Tier 1 Metrics (Baseline Assessment)

### 2.1. Structural Coupling

**Definition:** Count of files/functions that directly depend on changed code

**Mathematical Formula:**
```
coupling_score(file) = COUNT(DISTINCT neighbor)
  WHERE (file)-[:IMPORTS|CALLS]-(neighbor)
  AND hop_distance = 1
```

**Graph Query (Conceptual Cypher):**
```cypher
MATCH (f:File {path: $changed_file})-[:IMPORTS|CALLS]-(dep)
RETURN count(DISTINCT dep) as coupling_count
```

**Threshold Logic:**
- `coupling_count ≤ 5`: **LOW** - Limited blast radius
- `5 < coupling_count ≤ 10`: **MEDIUM** - Moderate impact
- `coupling_count > 10`: **HIGH** - Wide impact, escalate to Phase 2

**Rationale:**
- Coupling is **factual** (dependencies are explicit in code)
- 1-hop limit prevents explosion (10 deps × 10 subdeps = 100+ nodes)
- **FP Rate: ~1-2%** (false positives occur when dependencies are intentional framework patterns)

**Evidence Format:**
```
"File auth.py is imported by 12 other files (HIGH coupling)"
```

**Cache Strategy:**
- Redis key: `coupling:{repo_id}:{file_path}`
- TTL: 15 minutes
- Invalidate on: git commit to file or its dependencies

### 2.2. Temporal Co-Change

**Definition:** Files that frequently change together in git history (90-day window)

**Mathematical Formula:**
```
co_change_frequency(fileA, fileB) =
  COUNT(commits where both files changed) / COUNT(commits where either changed)

Measured over 90-day window with linear decay:
  weight(commit) = 1.0 - (days_ago / 90)
```

**Graph Query (Conceptual Cypher):**
```cypher
MATCH (f:File {path: $changed_file})-[r:CO_CHANGED]-(other)
WHERE r.frequency > 0.3  // Filter weak relationships
RETURN other.path, r.frequency, r.last_timestamp
ORDER BY r.frequency DESC
LIMIT 10
```

**Threshold Logic:**
- `frequency ≤ 0.3`: **LOW** - Weak coupling
- `0.3 < frequency ≤ 0.7`: **MEDIUM** - Moderate coupling
- `frequency > 0.7`: **HIGH** - Strong evolutionary coupling

**Rationale:**
- Co-change is **observable** (commit history is ground truth)
- 90-day window balances recency with statistical significance
- **FP Rate: ~3-5%** (false positives when files change for unrelated reasons, e.g., mass formatting)

**Evidence Format:**
```
"auth.py and permissions.py changed together in 15 of last 20 commits (75% co-change frequency)"
```

**Pre-Computation:**
- CO_CHANGED edges computed during `crisk init` and incremental updates
- Stored as graph relationship with `frequency` property
- No runtime calculation needed (just read edge weight)

**Cache Strategy:**
- Redis key: `co_change:{repo_id}:{file_path}`
- TTL: 15 minutes
- Invalidate on: git commit to file

### 2.3. Test Coverage Ratio

**Definition:** Ratio of test code to source code (lines of code)

**Mathematical Formula:**
```
test_ratio(source_file) =
  SUM(test_file.loc for all related test files) / source_file.loc

Test file discovery:
  1. Naming convention: *_test.py, test_*.py, *.test.js
  2. Directory convention: tests/, __tests__/, spec/
  3. Graph relationship: (test)-[:TESTS]->(source)
```

**Graph Query (Conceptual Cypher):**
```cypher
MATCH (source:File {path: $changed_file})
MATCH (test:File)-[:TESTS]->(source)
RETURN source.loc as source_loc,
       SUM(test.loc) as total_test_loc,
       (SUM(test.loc) * 1.0 / source.loc) as test_ratio
```

**Threshold Logic:**
- `test_ratio ≥ 0.8`: **LOW** - Excellent coverage
- `0.3 ≤ test_ratio < 0.8`: **MEDIUM** - Adequate coverage
- `test_ratio < 0.3`: **HIGH** - Insufficient coverage

**Rationale:**
- Test ratio is **factual** (lines of code are countable)
- Naming conventions work for 95%+ of projects
- **FP Rate: ~5-8%** (false positives when tests are in non-standard locations or use different styles)

**Evidence Format:**
```
"auth.py (250 LOC) has auth_test.py (75 LOC), test ratio = 0.3 (MEDIUM coverage)"
```

**Smoothing (Avoid Division by Zero):**
```
smoothed_ratio = (test_loc + 1) / (source_loc + 1)
```

**Cache Strategy:**
- Redis key: `test_ratio:{repo_id}:{file_path}`
- TTL: 15 minutes
- Invalidate on: git commit to source file or test file

### 2.4. Phase 1 Heuristic (Escalation Logic)

**Decision Tree:**
```
IF (coupling_count > 10) OR
   (co_change_frequency > 0.7) OR
   (test_ratio < 0.3)
THEN
  risk_level = HIGH
  escalate_to_phase2 = TRUE
ELSE
  risk_level = LOW
  return_early = TRUE  // No LLM needed
END
```

**Rationale:**
- **80% of code changes are low-risk** and don't need LLM investigation
- Simple OR logic (not weighted scoring) to avoid false negatives
- Conservative thresholds to err on side of caution

**Performance Characteristics:**
- **LOW risk path (80% of checks):** ~200ms, no LLM calls, $0.00
- **HIGH risk path (20% of checks):** ~3-5s, 3-4 LLM calls, $0.03-0.05

---

## 3. Tier 2 Metrics (LLM-Requested)

### 3.1. Ownership Churn

**Definition:** Primary code owner changed recently (within 90-day window)

**Mathematical Formula:**
```
owner_churn(file) = {
  current_owner: developer with most commits in last 30 days,
  previous_owner: developer with most commits in days 31-90,
  days_since_transition: days since ownership changed,
  is_high_churn: days_since_transition < 30
}

Ownership strength:
  primary_ownership = commits_by_owner / total_commits_90_days
  is_strong: primary_ownership > 0.5
  is_shared: 0.2 < primary_ownership ≤ 0.5
  is_weak: primary_ownership ≤ 0.2
```

**Data Source:**
- Git commit history (AUTHORED relationships in graph)
- Aggregate by developer email
- 90-day sliding window

**Threshold Logic:**
- `days_since_transition > 90`: **LOW** - Stable ownership
- `30 ≤ days_since_transition ≤ 90`: **MEDIUM** - Recent transition
- `days_since_transition < 30`: **HIGH** - Very recent transition (churn)

**Rationale:**
- Ownership churn is **observable** (commit authorship is factual)
- Recent transitions increase risk (new owner may lack context)
- **FP Rate: ~5-7%** (false positives when experienced developers take over code)

**Evidence Format:**
```
"Primary owner changed from bob@example.com to alice@example.com 14 days ago (MEDIUM ownership stability)"
```

**When LLM Requests:**
- HIGH coupling + LOW test ratio → Check if new owner is experienced
- Frequent co-change → Check if ownership is shared across coupled files

**Cache Strategy:**
- Redis key: `ownership:{repo_id}:{file_path}`
- TTL: 1 hour (slower to change than code metrics)
- Invalidate on: git push to main branch

### 3.2. Incident Similarity (BM25 Only)

**Definition:** Keyword similarity between commit message and past incident descriptions

**Mathematical Formula:**
```
BM25 Score (Simplified):
  score(query, doc) = SUM over terms t in query:
    IDF(t) * (TF(t, doc) * (k1 + 1)) / (TF(t, doc) + k1 * (1 - b + b * |doc| / avg_doc_length))

Where:
  TF(t, doc) = term frequency of t in document
  IDF(t) = log(N / DF(t))  // N = total incidents, DF = incidents containing t
  k1 = 1.5, b = 0.75  // Standard BM25 parameters
```

**Data Source:**
- Incident descriptions from GitHub Issues (labels: "incident", "bug", "outage")
- Manually linked via `CAUSED_BY` relationship (Incident → Commit)
- Query: changed file's commit message + last 3 commit messages

**Similarity Threshold:**
- `score < 5.0`: **LOW** - No similar incidents
- `5.0 ≤ score < 10.0`: **MEDIUM** - Weak similarity
- `score ≥ 10.0`: **HIGH** - Strong similarity

**Rationale:**
- **BM25 is sufficient** - Vector embeddings add <5% accuracy improvement at 10x cost
- Text matching is **observable** (keywords are explicit)
- **FP Rate: ~8-12%** (false positives from generic keywords like "timeout", "error")

**Evidence Format:**
```
"Commit mentions 'auth timeout' similar to Incident #123: 'Auth service timeout after 30s' (BM25 score: 12.3)"
```

**Why Not Vector Embeddings:**
- Vector search cost: $0.10 per 1M tokens (embedding) + infrastructure overhead
- PostgreSQL FTS cost: $0.00 (included in existing database, see ADR-003)
- Accuracy difference: ~3-5% (not worth complexity increase)

**When LLM Requests:**
- HIGH coupling + ownership churn → Check for similar past failures
- Multiple HIGH signals → Validate with incident history

**Cache Strategy:**
- Redis key: `incidents:{repo_id}:{file_path}`
- TTL: 30 minutes (incidents change slowly)
- Invalidate on: new incident created or linked

---

## 4. Metric Composition (Risk Level Synthesis)

### 4.1. Phase 1 Output (No LLM)

**Output Structure:**
```json
{
  "risk_level": "LOW" | "MEDIUM" | "HIGH",
  "confidence": 0.0,  // Phase 1 has no confidence (heuristic only)
  "metrics": {
    "coupling": {"value": 8, "signal": "MEDIUM", "threshold": 10},
    "co_change": {"value": 0.45, "signal": "MEDIUM", "threshold": 0.7},
    "test_ratio": {"value": 0.6, "signal": "MEDIUM", "threshold": 0.3}
  },
  "needs_investigation": false,  // FALSE if risk_level = LOW
  "duration_ms": 187
}
```

**Decision Logic:**
```
IF ANY(metric.signal == "HIGH"):
  risk_level = "HIGH"
  needs_investigation = TRUE
ELSE IF ALL(metric.signal == "LOW"):
  risk_level = "LOW"
  needs_investigation = FALSE
ELSE:
  risk_level = "MEDIUM"
  needs_investigation = FALSE  // V1: Only HIGH escalates
```

### 4.2. Phase 2 Output (LLM Synthesis)

**LLM Input (Evidence Chain):**
```
Tier 1 Metrics (always calculated):
- Structural coupling: 12 files depend on this code (HIGH)
- Co-change frequency: 0.75 with auth.py (HIGH)
- Test coverage ratio: 0.3 (MEDIUM)

Tier 2 Metrics (requested by LLM):
- Ownership churn: Primary owner changed 14 days ago (MEDIUM)
- Incident similarity: Similar to Incident #123 "Auth timeout" (score: 12.3, HIGH)
```

**LLM Output (Synthesized Assessment):**
```json
{
  "risk_level": "HIGH",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "key_evidence": [
    "12 files directly depend on this code (high coupling)",
    "75% co-change frequency with auth.py (tight temporal coupling)",
    "Code owner changed 14 days ago (ownership instability)",
    "Similar to Incident #123: 'Auth timeout after permission check'"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Add integration tests for permission check timeout scenarios",
    "Review auth module coupling (consider facade pattern)",
    "Ensure new owner (alice@) is familiar with incident #123"
  ],
  "reasoning": "High coupling + ownership churn + incident history = elevated risk",
  "duration_ms": 4200,
  "llm_calls": 4
}
```

**Confidence Scoring (LLM-Generated):**
- `confidence ≥ 0.8`: Strong evidence from multiple independent sources
- `0.5 ≤ confidence < 0.8`: Moderate evidence, some conflicting signals
- `confidence < 0.5`: Weak evidence, unclear risk

---

## 5. Metric Validation Framework

### 5.1. False Positive Tracking

**User Feedback Loop:**
```bash
# Developer sees HIGH risk assessment
$ crisk check
→ Risk: HIGH
→ Coupling: 12 files depend on this (HIGH)
→ Co-change: 0.8 frequency with auth.py (HIGH)

# Developer disagrees (intentional coupling in framework code)
$ crisk feedback --false-positive --reason "Intentional coupling in framework code"

# System records feedback in Postgres
INSERT INTO metric_validations (metric_name, file_path, metric_value, user_feedback, feedback_reason)
VALUES ('coupling', 'auth.py', '{"value": 12, "evidence": "..."}', 'false_positive', 'Intentional coupling in framework code')

# Update aggregate statistics
UPDATE metric_stats
SET false_positives = false_positives + 1,
    total_uses = total_uses + 1
WHERE metric_name = 'coupling'
```

**Auto-Disablement Logic:**
```sql
-- Check if metric should be disabled (FP rate > 3% and n ≥ 20)
SELECT metric_name, fp_rate, total_uses
FROM metric_stats
WHERE fp_rate > 0.03 AND total_uses >= 20

-- If true, disable metric
UPDATE metric_stats
SET is_enabled = FALSE
WHERE metric_name = $1
```

**Metric Re-Enabling:**
- Admin reviews disabled metrics quarterly
- Investigates common false positive reasons
- Adjusts thresholds or calculation logic
- Re-enables metric with new configuration

### 5.2. Validation Schema (Postgres)

**Tables:**
```sql
-- Individual validation records
CREATE TABLE metric_validations (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    metric_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    file_path VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    metric_value JSONB NOT NULL,  -- Full metric output
    user_feedback VARCHAR(20),    -- 'true_positive', 'false_positive', null
    feedback_reason TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Aggregate statistics per metric
CREATE TABLE metric_stats (
    metric_name VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    total_uses INT DEFAULT 0,
    false_positives INT DEFAULT 0,
    true_positives INT DEFAULT 0,
    fp_rate FLOAT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
        CASE WHEN total_uses > 0
        THEN false_positives::FLOAT / total_uses
        ELSE 0.0 END
    ) STORED,
    is_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Query for Disabled Metrics:**
```sql
SELECT
    metric_name,
    fp_rate,
    total_uses,
    STRING_AGG(DISTINCT feedback_reason, ', ' ORDER BY feedback_reason) as common_reasons
FROM metric_validations v
JOIN metric_stats s ON v.metric_name = s.metric_name
WHERE s.is_enabled = FALSE AND v.user_feedback = 'false_positive'
GROUP BY metric_name, fp_rate, total_uses
```

## 6. Integration with Graph Ontology

### 6.1. Data Flow (Graph → Metrics → LLM)

**Step 1: Graph Data Extraction**
```
Neo4j/Neptune Graph
  ↓
1-hop query: (File)-[:IMPORTS|CALLS]-(neighbors)
  ↓
Load into working memory (NodeSet)
```

**Step 2: Metric Calculation**
```
Working Memory (in-memory graph subset)
  ↓
Parallel calculation: coupling, co_change, test_ratio
  ↓
Cache in Redis (15-min TTL)
```

**Step 3: Evidence Formatting**
```
Metric Results (JSON)
  ↓
Format as natural language evidence
  ↓
Add to LLM context
```

**Step 4: LLM Reasoning**
```
LLM Context (evidence + graph structure)
  ↓
LLM decides: CALCULATE_METRIC | EXPAND_GRAPH | FINALIZE
  ↓
Synthesize final risk assessment
```

### 6.2. Cypher Query Patterns

**Coupling Query:**
```cypher
// 1-hop dependency count
MATCH (f:File {path: $changed_file})-[:IMPORTS|CALLS]-(dep)
RETURN count(DISTINCT dep) as coupling_count
```

**Co-Change Query:**
```cypher
// Read pre-computed CO_CHANGED edge weight
MATCH (f:File {path: $changed_file})-[r:CO_CHANGED]-(other)
WHERE r.frequency > 0.3
RETURN other.path, r.frequency, r.last_timestamp
ORDER BY r.frequency DESC
LIMIT 10
```

**Test Ratio Query:**
```cypher
// Find test files via naming convention + relationship
MATCH (source:File {path: $changed_file})
OPTIONAL MATCH (test:File)-[:TESTS]->(source)
RETURN source.loc as source_loc,
       COALESCE(SUM(test.loc), 0) as test_loc,
       COALESCE(SUM(test.loc) * 1.0 / source.loc, 0.0) as test_ratio
```

**Ownership Query (via git commits):**
```cypher
// Aggregate commits by developer in 90-day window
MATCH (f:File {path: $changed_file})<-[:MODIFIES]-(c:Commit)-[:AUTHORED_BY]->(d:Developer)
WHERE c.timestamp > datetime() - duration({days: 90})
WITH d.email as owner,
     count(c) as commit_count,
     max(c.timestamp) as last_commit
ORDER BY commit_count DESC
RETURN owner, commit_count, last_commit
LIMIT 2  // Current and previous owner
```

### 6.3. Cache Invalidation Strategy

**Invalidation Triggers:**
| Event | Invalidate Keys | Reason |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| Git commit to main | `coupling:{file}`, `co_change:{file}`, `test_ratio:{file}` | Structure or history changed |
| Git commit to branch | Branch-specific keys only | Main graph unchanged |
| New incident linked | `incidents:{affected_files}` | Incident database updated |
| CODEOWNERS update | `ownership:{all_files}` | Ownership changed |

**Invalidation Patterns:**
```
# Wildcard invalidation (commit to main)
KEYS coupling:{repo_id}:src/auth/*
DEL coupling:{repo_id}:src/auth/permissions.py
DEL coupling:{repo_id}:src/auth/roles.py
...

# Targeted invalidation (new incident)
DEL incidents:{repo_id}:src/auth/permissions.py
```

---

## 7. Performance Characteristics

### 7.1. Latency Budget (Per Check)

**Phase 1 (80% of checks):**
| Component | Target | Typical | Optimization |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------------|
| Coupling query | <50ms | 40ms | 1-hop limit, indexed |
| Co-change query | <20ms | 15ms | Edge property read |
| Test ratio query | <50ms | 45ms | Pre-computed relationships |
| Heuristic eval | <10ms | 5ms | Simple if/else |
| **Total Phase 1** | **<200ms** | **150ms** | **Parallel queries** |

**Phase 2 (20% of checks, HIGH risk only):**
| Component | Target | Typical | Optimization |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------------|
| Load 1-hop neighbors | <100ms | 80ms | Single batch query |
| LLM decision hop 1 | <1.5s | 1.2s | Cached graph data |
| LLM decision hop 2 | <1.2s | 1.0s | Smaller context |
| LLM synthesis | <1.0s | 0.8s | Structured output |
| **Total Phase 2** | **<5s** | **3.8s** | **Max 3 hops** |

### 7.2. Cost Model

**Phase 1 Cost (Per Check):**
- Neptune queries: $0.00 (serverless, billed by I/O)
- Redis cache: $0.00 (fixed monthly cost)
- **Total: ~$0.00** (infrastructure cost amortized)

**Phase 2 Cost (Per Check):**
- LLM calls: 4 requests × 1.5K tokens avg × $0.01/1K = $0.06
- Graph queries: $0.00 (cached from Phase 1)
- **Total: ~$0.03-0.06** (varies by LLM provider)

**Daily Cost (100 checks):**
- 80 LOW risk (Phase 1 only): 80 × $0.00 = $0.00
- 20 HIGH risk (Phase 1 + 2): 20 × $0.05 = $1.00
- **Total: ~$1.00/day** (vs $5-10/day with legacy approach)

## 8. Key Design Decisions (ADR Summary)

### 8.1. Why Simple Metrics Over Complex Models?

**Decision:** Use factual metrics (coupling, co-change) instead of statistical models (ΔDBR, G²)

**Rationale:**
- Factual metrics have **1-5% FP rate** vs 10-25% for statistical models
- Simple metrics are **explainable** ("12 files depend on this") vs opaque ("PPR delta = 0.34")
- Cost reduction: **$15 → $0 for init**, **$5 → $1 for daily checks**

**Trade-off:**
- Miss nuanced patterns (e.g., temporal decay in co-change)
- Rely on LLM to synthesize multiple signals vs single complex score

### 8.2. Why BM25 Over Vector Embeddings for Incidents?

**Decision:** Use BM25 text search only, skip vector embeddings

**Rationale:**
- BM25 achieves **~85% accuracy** vs **~88% for vector search**
- Cost: **$0.00 for BM25** vs **$0.10+ for embeddings**
- 3% accuracy improvement not worth 100x cost increase

**Trade-off:**
- Miss semantic similarity (e.g., "timeout" vs "unresponsive")
- Acceptable for V1, revisit if FP rate crosses threshold

### 8.3. Why 90-Day Historical Window?

**Decision:** Use 90-day window for co-change and ownership metrics

**Rationale:**
- **90 days balances recency with statistical significance**
- Shorter window (30 days): Too noisy, small sample size
- Longer window (180 days): Stale patterns, old ownership data

**Trade-off:**
- Miss long-term patterns (e.g., annual refactorings)
- Configurable per-repo in future versions

---

## 9. Future Enhancements (V2+)

**Adaptive Thresholds:**
- Learn optimal thresholds from user feedback
- Adjust per-repo (e.g., framework code has higher coupling baseline)

**Multi-File Risk:**
- Assess risk for entire PR (multiple files)
- Detect cross-file coupling patterns

**Temporal Decay (Simplified):**
- Add linear decay to co-change: `weight = 1.0 - (days_ago / 90)`
- Avoid complex Hawkes models, keep simple

**Custom Metrics:**
- Allow users to define repo-specific metrics
- Validate FP rate before enabling

## The Hook (Use Everywhere)



### One-Liner

*"I watched Oracle nearly destroy billion-dollar products with regression bugs. This tool catches them before you commit."*



### Three-Liner

*"After 3 years watching regression bugs destroy productivity at Oracle, I built CodeRisk - a tool that predicts if your code changes will cause incidents. Free, runs locally, no signup required. Just `pip install crisk && crisk check`."*



### The Oracle Story (For longer content)

*"At Oracle, I watched our team spend 70% of time fixing regressions instead of building features. One migration created a 6-month cascade of bugs. Customer escalations consumed entire sprints. The codebase felt totaled - unfixable but too valuable to abandon. I built CodeRisk to prevent others from living this nightmare."*

- **Community > Marketing**: Engage every single early user

- **Free > Paid**: Adoption first, monetization later

- **Simple > Complex**: One command to value



**The Goal**: If just 10 developers say "holy shit this is real" in Week 1, you've found product-market fit.



**Start building tonight. Launch this weekend.**

## **1) Purpose**



Give developers instant, **local**, explainable risk on **uncommitted or PR** changes across a large, moving repo. Core focus: **regression risk**, plus adjacent risks (API, schema, deps, perf, concurrency, security, config, tests, merge).



---



## **2) Inputs**



- **Working tree / PR diff:** file list, hunks, churn, renamed/moved info.

- **90-day sample (or chosen window W):** commits/PRs/issues/owners, import & co-change degrees, CODEOWNERS history.

- **Indexes:** IMPORTS & CO_CHANGED (Memgraph), embeddings/FT search (Postgres+pgvector).

- **Optional:** tests→files map (or coverage export), lockfiles, migration files, service configs.



---



## **3) Core Signals (Blueprint v4, bounded)**



*All graph queries ≤2 hops, degree-capped, ≤500 ms.*



1. **Δ-Diffusion Blast Radius (ΔDBR):** local PPR/HKPR delta from proposed edge deltas over IMPORTS/CO_CHANGED.

2. **Hawkes-Decayed Co-Change (HDCC):** two-timescale (fast/slow) decays for evolutionary coupling.

3. **G² Surprise:** Dunning log-likelihood for unusual file pairs (bounded triples on small degrees).

4. **Ownership Authority Mismatch (OAM):** owner_churn, minor_edit_ratio, experience_gap, bus_entropy.

5. **Span-Core & Bridge Risk:** temporal core persistence; bridging centrality in 2-hop IMPORTS subgraph.

6. **Incident Adjacency (GB-RRF):** fuse BM25 + vector kNN + local PPR ranks via Reciprocal Rank Fusion.

7. **JIT Baselines:** size (touched files; auto-High cutoff), churn, diff entropy.



*All features emit grounded evidence (file/edge/issue IDs).*



---



## **4) Micro-Detectors (new category features)**



Each runs on the **working-tree diff**, time-boxed, deterministic; returns {score∈[0,1], reasons[], anchors[]}.



1. **api_break_risk (50–150 ms):** AST diff of **public surface**; score = breaking-delta severity × importer count (from IMPORTS).

2. **schema_risk (10–40 ms):** migration ops (DROP/NOT NULL/type) × backfill/down/flag checks × table fan-out proxy.

3. **dep_risk (10–30 ms):** lockfile diff; major bumps, transitive pin churn (+ optional offline OSV).

4. **perf_risk (20–60 ms):** loop+I/O/DB call, string-concat-in-loop; weight by ΔDBR/centrality.

5. **concurrency_risk (20–60 ms):** new shared-state writes, lock order changes, missing await/mutex around shared data.

6. **security_risk (30–120 ms):** mini-SAST (unsafe YAML, SQL concat, path joins, JWT none) + secrets (regex+entropy).

7. **config_risk (10–40 ms):** k8s/tf/yaml/json risky key deltas × service fan-out proxy.

8. **test_gap_risk (10–20 ms):** (tests near T)/(churn in T) with smoothing; low ratio ⇒ high risk.

9. **merge_risk (10–20 ms):** overlap with upstream on **high-HDCC** hotspots; rebase hint.



---



## **5) Scoring & Tiering**



- **Feature vector:** [v4 signals …, api_break_risk, schema_risk, …, merge_risk] → normalize per repo/window.

- **Monotone scorer:** linear or monotone-boosted; all new features **non-decreasing** w.r.t. risk.

- **Tiers:** repo-local quantiles + **Conformal Risk Control (CRC)** to bound false-escalations (e.g., ≤5%) per segment (e.g., size bucket).

- **Auto-High rules (conservative):**

- api_break_risk ≥0.9 with importer_count ≥ P95

- schema_risk ≥0.9 with (DROP | NOT NULL) and no backfill

- security_risk ≥0.9 (secret or critical sink)

- **Policy:** LLMs can **explain or escalate**, **never de-escalate**.



---



## **6) LLM Usage (strict, bounded)**



- **Search labeling & triage:** (Modes A/B) name risky conduits; propose **test names** when mapping is sparse.

- **Action planning (High only):** (Mode C) suggest mitigations; deterministic simulator scores expected Δrisk.

- **Summaries:** 1 short explanation for High citing IDs.

- **Offline rule mining:** distill recurring incidents into new deterministic rulelets.

- **Guardrails:** tool-bounded JSON I/O; token/tool budgets; no code exec; no de-escalation.



---



## **7) LLM-Guided Search (no score ownership change)**



- **Mode A — Beam (≤300 ms):** risk-directed beam over IMPORTS∪CO_CHANGED; heuristic


h(n)=αΔDBR+βHDCC+γBridge+δIncidentSim+εOAM+ζCategoryHint.


- **Mode B — Bidirectional (≤600 ms, High only):** meet-in-the-middle S→G path proof.

- **Mode C — Constrained MCTS (≤1.5 s, High on click):** optimize tests/reviewers/canary under budgets using deterministic Δscore.



---



## **8) APIs**



- POST /assess_worktree → tier, score, **categories** (see payload), top_signals, evidence links.

- POST /score_pr → v4 features + detectors for PR SHA.

- POST /search/beam | /search/bidir → risk paths (IDs) + trace (nodes, ms).

- POST /plan/mcts → ranked mitigation plan with expected Δrisk.

---



## **10) Performance & SLAs**



- **Score path (warm):** ≤2 s p50 / ≤5 s p95.

- **Detectors (all 9):** ~150–450 ms p50; ~700–900 ms p95 (independently skippable).

- **Graph ops:** ≤2 hops, degree caps (~200), ≤10k nodes scanned, ≤500 ms per query.

- **Storage:** unchanged from v4 (Memgraph + Postgres/pgvector); optional tiny migrations table.



---



## **11) Telemetry & Acceptance**



- Log: nodes_expanded/ms for search, detector timeouts, auto-High triggers (with anchors), CRC version/segment.

- **Ship criteria:**

- /assess_worktree ≤2.5 s p95; ≥6/9 detector scores present.

- Beam yields ≥1 path **or** “no path within 2 hops” badge with trace.

- High PRs show a causal path ≥60% where recent incidents exist.

- No LLM de-escalations; attempts logged.



---



**One-liner:** *A deterministic, local, bounded risk engine (v4) extended with nine micro-detectors and LLM-guided search for paths & plans—exposed via GitHub checks, a local Workbench, and MCP tools for instant, in-editor feedback on uncommitted diffs.*

# Regression Risk Scaling Model



## The Regression Multiplier Effect



### Core Formula



```

Regression Risk (RR) = Base Risk × Team Factor × Codebase Factor × Change Velocity × Migration Multiplier



RR = BR × TF × CF × CV × MM



Where:

- BR (Base Risk) = 1.0 (normalized baseline)

- TF (Team Factor) = 1 + 0.3 × log₂(team_size)

- CF (Codebase Factor) = 1 + 0.2 × (LOC / 100,000) × (coupling_coefficient)

- CV (Change Velocity) = 1 + (commits_per_week / 100)

- MM (Migration Multiplier) = 2^(major_version_changes) × 1.5^(breaking_api_changes)

```



### Detailed Component Analysis



#### 1. Team Factor (TF)

**Formula**: `1 + 0.3 × log₂(team_size)`



| Team Size | TF Value | Risk Increase |

|-----------|----------|---------------|

| 1 dev | 1.0 | Baseline |

| 2 devs | 1.3 | +30% |

| 4 devs | 1.6 | +60% |

| 8 devs | 1.9 | +90% |

| 16 devs | 2.2 | +120% |

| 32 devs | 2.5 | +150% |

| 64 devs | 2.8 | +180% |



**Why it scales logarithmically**: Communication paths grow as n(n-1)/2, but effective communication degrades logarithmically due to team hierarchies and specialization.



#### 2. Codebase Factor (CF)

**Formula**: `1 + 0.2 × (LOC / 100,000) × coupling_coefficient`



**Coupling Coefficient** (0.0 to 1.0):

- 0.2 = Well-modularized microservices

- 0.4 = Service-oriented architecture

- 0.6 = Modular monolith

- 0.8 = Tightly coupled monolith

- 1.0 = "Big ball of mud"



| Codebase Size | Coupling | CF Value | Risk Increase |

|---------------|----------|----------|---------------|

| 10K LOC | 0.4 | 1.008 | +0.8% |

| 100K LOC | 0.4 | 1.08 | +8% |

| 500K LOC | 0.6 | 1.60 | +60% |

| 1M LOC | 0.8 | 2.60 | +160% |

| 5M LOC | 1.0 | 11.0 | +1000% |



#### 3. Change Velocity (CV)

**Formula**: `1 + (commits_per_week / 100)`



| Commits/Week | CV Value | Risk Increase |

|--------------|----------|---------------|

| 10 | 1.10 | +10% |

| 50 | 1.50 | +50% |

| 100 | 2.00 | +100% |

| 200 | 3.00 | +200% |

| 500 | 6.00 | +500% |



#### 4. Migration Multiplier (MM)

**Formula**: `2^(major_version_changes) × 1.5^(breaking_api_changes)`



| Migration Type | MM Value | Risk Increase |

|----------------|----------|---------------|

| Patch update | 1.0 | 0% |

| Minor update | 1.2 | +20% |

| 1 major version | 2.0 | +100% |

| 2 major versions | 4.0 | +300% |

| Framework migration | 8.0 | +700% |

| Language version (Python 2→3) | 16.0 | +1500% |

## Key Insight



**The Regression Paradox**:

- Solo devs don't have regression problems (low value)

- Enterprise teams have massive regression problems (high value, slow sales)

- **Solution**: Start with solo dev problems, grow into regression as they scale



**The Migration Opportunity**:

- Even small teams face migration risk

- Migrations are time-bounded (urgency)

- Clear before/after value demonstration

- **Could be the wedge for immediate value**



---

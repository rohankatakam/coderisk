# Greptile: Comprehensive Technical Analysis

## Executive Summary

Greptile is a **graph-based code review system** that operates at the **pull request (PR) level**, building a complete codebase knowledge graph to provide context-aware suggestions. It learns from team behavior to reduce noise and enforce organizational standards.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Graph-Based Codebase Context

Greptile builds a **complete codebase graph** containing:

```
Repository Graph Structure:
├── Files (nodes)
├── Functions (nodes)
├── Classes (nodes)
├── Variables (nodes)
├── Imports (edges)
├── Function calls (edges)
├── Dependencies (edges)
└── Variable usage (edges)
```

**Key Components:**
- **Nodes**: Every code element (files, functions, classes, variables)
- **Edges**: Relationships between elements (calls, imports, dependencies)
- **Metadata**: Type information, signatures, documentation

### 2. Indexing Process

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[New Repository] --> B[Parse All Files]
    B --> C[Extract Entities]
    C --> D[Map Relationships]
    D --> E[Build Graph]
    E --> F[Store Graph]
    F --> G[Ready for Reviews]
```

**Indexing Steps:**
1. **Repository Scanning**: Parse every file using AST analysis
2. **Entity Extraction**: Identify functions, classes, variables
3. **Relationship Mapping**: Connect all code elements
4. **Graph Storage**: Persist complete graph for instant querying

### 3. Context-Aware Analysis

When reviewing a function change, Greptile queries:

#### Direct Dependencies
```javascript
function foo(x) {
  // Greptile identifies:
  ├── validateInput()     // Called functions
  ├── database.save()      // External calls
  ├── CONFIG.timeout       // Variables accessed
  └── lodash, ./utils     // Imports used
}
```

#### Usage Analysis
```javascript
// Finds all callers of foo():
├── components/UserForm.tsx:45
├── services/DataService.ts:12
└── tests/integration.test.ts:78
// → Impact: changes affect 3 files
```

#### Pattern Consistency
```javascript
// Compares with similar functions:
getUserById() → uses parameterized queries ✓
getOrderById() → uses string concatenation ⚠️
// → Suggests: "Match parameterized pattern"
```

## Learning & Adaptation System

### 1. Commit Analysis

Greptile analyzes first and last commits to determine which suggestions were implemented:

```
Comment Made → PR Completed → Was it addressed?
├── Yes → Continue suggesting similar items
└── No → Reduce priority or suppress
```

### 2. Reaction-Based Learning

```
👍 Positive reaction → Reinforce pattern
👎 Negative reaction → Suppress pattern
No reaction → Track ignore count
```

### 3. Noise Reduction Algorithm

```python
if comment_ignored >= 3 and not is_critical:
    suppress_comment_type()
elif is_security_issue or is_logic_error:
    always_surface()  # Never suppress critical issues
```

**What Gets Suppressed:**
- Style issues (semicolons, indentation)
- Naming conventions
- Import ordering
- Documentation gaps (if team ignores)

**Never Suppressed:**
- Security vulnerabilities
- Logic errors
- Performance bottlenecks
- Data integrity issues

### 4. Learning Timeline

```
Week 1-2:  Generic suggestions, high noise
Week 3-4:  Learning preferences, filtering begins
Week 5-8:  Custom patterns emerge
Week 9+:   Personalized recommendations
```

## Custom Rules Engine

### Auto-Discovery
Greptile automatically infers rules from team behavior:

```
Observed: "Move DB calls to service layer" (5+ times)
→ Generated Rule: "Controllers should not contain direct database calls"

Observed: "Add input validation" (3+ times)
→ Generated Rule: "API endpoints require input validation"
```

### Rule Categories

1. **Architecture & Design**
   - Layer separation (controllers, services, repositories)
   - Design pattern enforcement
   - API conventions

2. **Security & Compliance**
   - Input validation requirements
   - SQL injection prevention
   - Authentication/authorization checks
   - Audit logging requirements

3. **Code Quality**
   - Error handling patterns
   - Complexity limits
   - Testing requirements
   - Performance patterns

## Technical Moats & IP

- **IP**: Algorithm for efficient graph construction and storage
- **Advantage**: Instant context retrieval during reviews

### 2. Learning Algorithm
- **Moat**: Behavioral analysis from commits and reactions
- **IP**: Noise reduction algorithm that adapts to team preferences
- **Advantage**: Reduces review fatigue over time

### 3. Pattern Recognition

- **IP**: Consistency checking across similar functions
- **Advantage**: Catches inconsistencies humans miss

### 4. Custom Rule Inference
- **Moat**: Automatic rule generation from team behavior

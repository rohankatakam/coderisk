# Checkpoint 4: Performance Benchmark Readiness Assessment

**Date:** October 10, 2025
**Agent 4:** Testing & Continuous Validation
**Status:** ‚è≥ **PARTIAL READINESS** - Some benchmarks possible, others blocked

---

## Executive Summary

**Current Situation:** Checkpoint 4 requires all agents to complete before running comprehensive performance benchmarks. However, Agent 1 has not finished Phase 0 integration (Checkpoints 3-5 pending).

**What CAN Be Benchmarked Now:**
- ‚úÖ Agent 3's confidence loop (already integrated in check.go)
- ‚úÖ Current baseline Phase 1 latency (for comparison)
- ‚úÖ Current false positive rate (baseline measurement)

**What CANNOT Be Benchmarked Yet:**
- ‚ùå Phase 0 performance (not integrated - Agent 1 incomplete)
- ‚ùå Adaptive config impact (not integrated - Agent 2 complete but not wired in)
- ‚ùå Full system performance with all optimizations

**Recommendation:** Run **partial benchmarks** on what IS integrated, document blockers, prepare infrastructure for full benchmarks once integrations complete.

## What CAN Be Benchmarked Now

### 1. Confidence Loop Performance ‚úÖ

**Already Integrated - Can Benchmark:**
- Dynamic hop behavior (1-5 iterations vs fixed 3)
- Early stopping rate (% of cases stopping before hop 3)
- Average hops per investigation
- Latency improvement (dynamic vs fixed 3-hop)
- Breakthrough detection accuracy

**Expected Metrics (from Agent 3 tests):**
- Average hops: 2.0 (vs fixed 3.0) = 33% reduction
- Early stop rate: 50% (exceeds 40% target)
- Confidence threshold: 0.85

**Benchmark Method:**
1. Run `crisk check` on 20+ omnara test files
2. Track investigation hops (extract from --explain output)
3. Measure Phase 2 latency
4. Calculate early stop percentage
5. Compare to theoretical 3-hop fixed baseline

### 2. Current Baseline Metrics ‚úÖ

**Can Measure for Comparison:**
- Current false positive rate (before optimizations)
- Current average latency (Phase 1 + Phase 2)
- Current Phase 1 latency distribution
- Cache hit rate

**Benchmark Method:**
1. Run `crisk check` on omnara repository (all changed files)
2. Manually validate false positives (compare risk level to actual file change)
3. Record latency for each file (Phase 1 + Phase 2 if escalated)
4. Generate baseline report for future comparison

### 3. Infrastructure Readiness ‚úÖ

**Can Prepare:**
- Benchmark test file selection (choose 50+ representative files)
- Performance tracking scripts (automated latency measurement)
- False positive validation methodology (manual review checklist)
- Report generation templates

## What CANNOT Be Benchmarked Yet

### 1. Phase 0 Impact ‚ùå

**Blocked By:** Agent 1 incomplete (Checkpoints 3-5 pending)

**Cannot Measure:**
- Documentation skip latency (<50ms target)
- Security escalation accuracy
- Production config detection
- Phase 0 coverage rate (% of checks using Phase 0)
- Modification type classification accuracy

**Required for Benchmark:**
- Agent 1 completes Checkpoint 5 (Phase 0 orchestrator integration)
- `cmd/crisk/check.go` calls Phase 0 before Phase 1
- Phase 0 results propagated to investigation

### 2. Adaptive Config Impact ‚ùå

**Blocked By:** Agent 2 integration not done

**Cannot Measure:**
- False positive reduction from adaptive thresholds
- Domain inference accuracy on real repository
- Config selection appropriateness
- Threshold-specific performance (Python web vs Go backend)
- Coupling classification accuracy (adaptive vs fixed)

**Required for Benchmark:**
- Integrate `SelectConfigWithReason()` into check.go
- Replace `CalculatePhase1()` with `CalculatePhase1WithConfig()`
- Add repository metadata collection
- Wire adaptive thresholds into escalation logic

### 3. Full System Performance ‚ùå

**Blocked By:** Both Agent 1 and Agent 2 incomplete/not integrated

**Cannot Measure:**
- Total latency with all optimizations (Phase 0 + adaptive + confidence)
- Weighted average latency (accounting for Phase 0 skips)
- Overall false positive rate (with all optimizations)
- End-to-end performance distribution
- A/B comparison (optimized vs current system)

**Required for Benchmark:**
- All agents integrated
- Full system running Phase 0 ‚Üí Phase 1 (adaptive) ‚Üí Phase 2 (confidence-driven)
- Stable integration (no blocking bugs)

## Benchmark Infrastructure Design

### Files to Create

**`test/benchmark/performance_test.go`** (Go benchmark suite)
```go
// Benchmark: Phase 1 latency
func BenchmarkPhase1Latency(b *testing.B) { ... }

// Benchmark: Phase 2 investigation (with confidence loop)
func BenchmarkPhase2Investigation(b *testing.B) { ... }

// Benchmark: Full system (once integrated)
func BenchmarkFullSystem(b *testing.B) { ... }
```

**`test/e2e/performance_benchmark.sh`** (E2E performance test)
```bash
# Run crisk check on 50+ files
# Measure: latency per file, false positive rate, cache hits
# Output: CSV report with metrics
```

**`test/e2e/false_positive_validation.sh`** (Manual FP review)
```bash
# Test files with expected risk levels
# Compare crisk output to expected
# Calculate FP rate
```

### Performance Metrics to Track

| Metric | Current Baseline | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|-----------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Average Latency** | ~2,500ms | ‚â§700ms | Time Phase 1 + Phase 2 per file |
| **False Positive Rate** | ~50% | ‚â§15% | Manual validation vs expected risk |
| **Phase 0 Skip Rate** | 0% | 40%+ | Count files skipped by Phase 0 |
| **Early Stop Rate** | 0% (fixed 3-hop) | 40%+ | Count investigations <3 hops |
| **Phase 1 Latency** | ~125ms | <150ms | Baseline + adaptive metrics |
| **Phase 2 Latency** | ~2,500ms | ~1,500ms | Confidence-driven vs fixed |

### Test Repository Selection

**omnara test repository provides:**
- 50+ Python files (web application)
- Security-sensitive files (auth, API routes)
- Documentation files (README, docs/)
- Configuration files (.env, configs/)
- Test files (tests/)
- Various modification types (security, docs, config, business logic)

**Test File Categories (for balanced benchmarking):**
1. **Security files (10):** `src/backend/auth/*.py`, `src/servers/api/auth.py`
2. **Documentation (10):** `README.md`, `docs/*.md`, inline comments
3. **Configuration (5):** `.env.production`, `config/`
4. **Business logic (20):** `src/backend/api/*.py`, `src/omnara/cli/*.py`
5. **Tests (5):** `tests/**/*.py`

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option A: Wait for Full Integration (Recommended)

**Timeline:** 6-7 days (Agent 1 completion + integration time)

**Approach:**
1. **Wait** for Agent 1 to complete Checkpoints 3-5
2. **Coordinate integration** of Agent 1 and Agent 2 work into check.go
3. **Then run full Checkpoint 4** benchmarks with all optimizations
4. **Result:** Comprehensive performance report with all metrics

**Pros:**
- Complete benchmark of full system
- Accurate performance measurements
- Can validate all targets (latency, FP rate, Phase 0 coverage)

**Cons:**
- Delayed by ~1 week
- Cannot provide interim performance feedback

### Option B: Partial Benchmarks Now + Full Later

**Timeline:** 1 day now + 7 days later

**Approach:**
1. **Today:** Run partial benchmarks on confidence loop (already integrated)
2. **Today:** Measure current baseline (for comparison)
3. **Today:** Prepare benchmark infrastructure (scripts, test files)
4. **Week 2:** Re-run full benchmarks after Agent 1 + Agent 2 integration
5. **Result:** Interim report now, comprehensive report later

**Pros:**
- Immediate validation of confidence loop performance
- Establishes baseline for future comparison
- Infrastructure ready when integration completes

**Cons:**
- Partial results may be misleading
- Need to run benchmarks twice

### Option C: Skip Checkpoint 4, Go to Checkpoint 5

**Timeline:** 1 day for regression tests

**Approach:**
1. **Skip** comprehensive performance benchmarks (blocked anyway)
2. **Run Checkpoint 5** (regression tests) to ensure no current functionality broken
3. **Return to Checkpoint 4** after all integrations complete

**Pros:**
- Unblocks validation workflow
- Ensures current system stability

**Cons:**
- No performance data until later
- Skips checkpoint order

## Integration Blockers Summary

### Critical Path to Full Benchmarks

**Day 1-7 (Agent 1 completes):**
1. Agent 1 Checkpoint 3: Environment detection
2. Agent 1 Checkpoint 4: Modification type classifier
3. Agent 1 Checkpoint 5: Phase 0 orchestrator + integration into check.go

**Day 8-9 (Agent 2 integration):**
1. Integrate adaptive config selector into check.go
2. Replace `CalculatePhase1()` with `CalculatePhase1WithConfig()`
3. Test integration (Agent 4 re-runs Checkpoint 2)

**Day 10-11 (Full system validation):**
1. Agent 4 runs Checkpoint 4 (full performance benchmarks)
2. Validate all targets met
3. Generate comprehensive performance report

**Total Time to Full Benchmarks:** ~10-11 days from today

## Questions for Manager

1. **Approach Decision:** Which option do you prefer?
   - **Option A:** Wait 7 days for full integration, then run complete benchmarks
   - **Option B:** Run partial benchmarks now (confidence loop), full later
   - **Option C:** Skip to Checkpoint 5 (regression tests), return to Checkpoint 4 later

2. **Integration Priority:** Should Agent 2's adaptive config be integrated NOW (before Agent 1 completes)?
   - **Pro:** Can benchmark adaptive config impact independently
   - **Con:** Agent 1 integration might conflict

3. **Agent 1 Status:** Is Agent 1 actively working on Checkpoints 3-5?
   - If YES: When is expected completion?
   - If NO: Should I coordinate with Agent 1 to resume work?

4. **Performance Targets:** Are the targets still valid?
   - Average latency: ‚â§700ms
   - False positive rate: ‚â§15%
   - Phase 0 coverage: 40%+
   - Early stop rate: 40%+

## Current Recommendation

**I recommend Option B (Partial Benchmarks Now + Full Later):**

1. **Today:** Run confidence loop benchmarks (validate Agent 3's work)
2. **Today:** Establish baseline metrics (current FP rate, latency)
3. **Today:** Prepare full benchmark infrastructure
4. **Week 2:** Run full benchmarks after all integrations complete

**Rationale:**
- Provides immediate feedback on confidence loop performance
- Establishes baseline for comparison
- Doesn't block progress while waiting for Agent 1
- Infrastructure ready when integration completes

**Next Step:** Awaiting manager approval to proceed with Option B or alternative approach.

Adaptive Configuration Validation Report
Generated: 2025-10-10 14:10:36
========================================

Test Objectives:
1. Validate domain inference accuracy (Python web app detection)
2. Verify config selection logic (python_web config selected)
3. Test adaptive threshold behavior (coupling, co-change, test ratio)
4. Measure false positive reduction vs fixed thresholds

Expected Outcomes:
- Domain inference: 90%+ accuracy
- Config selection: Appropriate for repository type
- FP reduction: 20-30% vs fixed thresholds

========================================


Test 1: Domain Inference
  Domain: 
  Config: 
  Coupling Threshold: 
  Result: FAILED

Test 2: Adaptive Threshold Behavior
  Same metrics (12 coupling, 0.65 co-change) classified differently by domain
  Result: PASSED

Test 3: Config Selection Reasoning
  Tested 4 different repository types
  Result: PASSED

Test 4: Phase 1 Integration
  Adaptive metrics implementation: Complete
  Integration into check command: Pending
Total Tests: 4

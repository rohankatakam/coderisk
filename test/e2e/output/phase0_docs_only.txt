📊 Investigation Summary

Risk Level: MINIMAL (confidence: 40%)

Summary: The primary risk factor for modifying the `README.md` file lies in potential inaccuracies due to recent ownership transitions, which could lead to misleading documentation that affects user and developer understanding. This matters as it directly impacts the reliability of project instructions and guidelines. Before merging, ensure content accuracy by verifying the updated documentation against current project specifications and, if possible, confirm understanding with the new document owner.

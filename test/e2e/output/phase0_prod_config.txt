📊 Investigation Summary
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Risk Level: MINIMAL (confidence: 40%)

Summary: Primary risk factor: Hidden dependencies in broader system architecture could introduce indirect vulnerabilities from changes to the .env.production file.

Why it matters (impact): Unforeseen interactions with other configuration files or components could lead to system misconfigurations, security issues, or unstable behavior.

What to check before merging: Carefully review the new data or configurations added to ensure they align with current production standards and verify there are no indirect dependencies that could be affected by these changes.

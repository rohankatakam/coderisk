Phase 0 Validation Test Report
Generated: 2025-10-10 13:51:20
========================================

Test Scenarios:
1. Security-Sensitive Change (auth.py) - Should detect security keywords and force CRITICAL
2. Documentation-Only Change (README.md) - Should skip Phase 1/2 and return LOW <50ms
3. Production Config Change (.env.production) - Should detect production env and force HIGH/CRITICAL

Expected Outcomes:
- 70-80% FP reduction vs baseline
- Phase 0 decisions <50ms
- 100% accuracy on security/docs/env detection

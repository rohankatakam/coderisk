Risk Level: MINIMAL (confidence: 27%)

Summary: The primary risk factor for modifying `test_sandbox/omnara/README.md` lies in potential historical severe incidents or ownership transitions that might introduce unforeseen issues. While the coupling and co-change frequencies are zero, which minimizes immediate risk, it's crucial to check for any past severe incidents or recent ownership changes involving this file before merging, as they could indicate underlying vulnerabilities or inconsistencies. Verifying these aspects will ensure stability and mitigate latent risks associated with this modification.

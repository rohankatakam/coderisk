📊 Investigation Summary
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Risk Level: MINIMAL (confidence: 40%)

Summary: The primary risk factor when modifying `test_sandbox/omnara/.env.production` is the recent ownership transition, which might introduce unfamiliarity with the file's context despite its stable history and lack of direct dependencies. While the immediate impact seems low, it is crucial to verify that no indirect dependencies or systemic issues are overlooked. Before merging, ensure that all related files or systems with potential INCIDENTS_BY or CO_CHANGED edges have been reviewed for recent high-severity incidents or frequent changes that might indirectly affect this file.
